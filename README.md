# pymqiwm
A wrapper module for pymqi

When i statred to use the pymqi module, i had no idea how to do certain things.
As time went, to perform the things I needed, I had to find code examples only to try and somehow hit the target as to
what is the proper syntax.

There are few objects that we can interact with as a developer when talking about the websphere queue manager.
I have created a wrapper to the pymqi package that lets you easily interact with the queue manager and any of its queues.
You are more than welcome to check any of the methods that are used so that you will get a basic understanding of how the
pymqi module works.

I hope that this piece of code will be helpful for anyone who tries to use the pymqi module.


Few pieces of the code where used from the project https://github.com/dsuch/pymqi/blob/master/docs/examples.rst, full credit goes to him.
I encourage you to check his work.
